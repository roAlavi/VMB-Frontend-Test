# VMB Front-end developer Test

## What I have done?
Put your description below.
[What I have done?](DevelopersIntro.md)

## What is this?

We ask our JavaScript candidates to take this test as part of our recruitment process. This is step one. If we like your submission we will invite you for the next steps. 

### What should it do?

Your task is to fork this repository and write a React/Angular simple dashboard that displays the current mix of connectivity types in the UK using circular gauges (i.e. how much wifi, fiber, 4G etc.).

Details of an API that you can call to load the data that you should display are provided below. 

### How should it work?

Definitely using React or Angular! 

How you decide to load and show the data is entirely up to you. 
You are free to use any libraries that you want (via `npm`) and you can choose how you wish to display the data. Some suggestions are:

* Huge numbers
* Tiled icons and numbers
* A chart of some kind
* Relative sized colour bands in a giant unicorn's rainbow puke

### Where can I find the UK connectivity mock data?

Here: http://www.mocky.io/v2/5ea0625a320000680094aeab

An example response is in `example_api_response.json`, where you can see that the data includes the relative percentage values of a variety of connectivities


### What are we looking for in the solution?

* A simple, readable, well-factored solution - not the fanciest charting library or middleware components you can find
* Automated tests
* Strong linting format
* Good folder structure
* Some form of visual styling - we don't care what technology you use for this but an un-styled `ul` is not good enough

### Anything else I should know?

* You can use any ES7/Typescript features (or earlier)
* You can use any libraries that you want
* We really like TDD
* A more complicated solution is rarely better than a simple one
* Some types of chart seem like a really obvious fit but are not actually very good at showing small values in a data set 

## Finishing
* Update `DevelopersIntro.md` file 
* If you have made any changes that require us to do more than just an `npm install` and `npm start` to run your solution then please make this clear in the readme
* Let your agent know that you're done and we will take a look in GitHub
